# the-house 

**the-house** is a cursed command line casino suite, in bash of course

## features

- persistent balance tracking
- russian roulette (high risk, high reward, or death)
- blackjack (just you vs the dealer)
- dice duel (bet on a roll off)
- coin flip (50/50. or is it?)
- "the pact" â€” you can sign it. but should you?

your progress, wins, and... mistakes are all remembered. even after death.

## installation
you can either use your favorite AUR helper, e.g. yay:
```bash
yay -S the-house
```
or manually clone and build the package yourself:
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/the-house.git
cd the-house
makepkg -si
